Are you sure there is a desk underneath this mess? Beside all of the open soda cans, candy wrappers, and a crusty bowl of partially eaten cereal is a pristinely wrapped text book.

It reads:
"C++ Early Objects, Eight Edition - Tony Gaddis, Judy Walters, Godfrey Muganda"

Hmmm I wonder if I should open that sometime this semester...
