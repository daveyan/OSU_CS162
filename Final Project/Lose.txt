What are you doing going out there without your "Wallet"?
How are you going to pay for your pizza.

The pizza guy stares at you with an open hand expecting some cash. After a few minutes of looking at you awkwardly he leaves with the pizza in his hands.

It's too late...

You LOSE...
The worst part of all this is that you don't get to eat pizza.
