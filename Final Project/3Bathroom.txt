As you enter the bathroom you can't help but enjoy the warm sunlight coming through the windows and reflecting off the shimmering tiles. There is a beauty to the bathroom that you just can't explain... However this realization is interrupted by the puddle on the floor.

Wait... is that water... or pee...?

Best to not stay in here too long.
