I'm not too sure where the desk odor is coming from, but I'm sure that there's one coming out of this closet.
There's clothes all over the place. At least all of my shirts are neatly stacked... on top of the pile of worn socks...

If I close the door, I won't have to see this mess. Out of sight means out of mind.
